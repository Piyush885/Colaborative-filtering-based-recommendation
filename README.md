There are three type of recommendation system
1-Demographic(See my project) 2- Content Based(Finding similarity between the content) 3- Collaborative based

# Colaborative-filtering-based-recommendation
This is an end to end project. Collaborative filtering based recommendation system is based on finding cosine similarity on product or user. 
In this project I have used product based filtering
The main difference between content based and colaborative based filtering is that content based need metadata while colaborative based donot
For example if we are working on movie recommendation system then content based find similarity based on genere of movie.But colaborative based filtering]
technique will find similarity between movie id or user id
